# Calendar

Hello Alex,

I am showing you today the solution of the problem I have implemented as part of the code challenge for your interview process.

It took me 1h 14mins to develop the solution I am presentig you today.

To execute the program, you must have node installed on your computer and then just need to run the comand:

``` javascript
node calendar
```
This will show you a calendar of the current year and month, showing today's day between dashes.

There are some parameters you can add too to play with it and have more fun. You can add a specific year and then a month by giving its number, so you can do something like

``` javascript
node calendar 2020 2
```

and you will see a calendar of the specific year and month. By using the provided example you will see a calendar of February, 2020.

I hope you enjoy playing with it as much as I did creating it!

Thanks a lot Alex! Hope to hear from you soon! 

Take care

Best,
Rafael
